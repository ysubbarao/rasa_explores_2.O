       " \"GOOd budget phone, but...Pros: 1) Decent Video/audio recording with minimum distortion. (noise cancellation is much much better than Redmi 5a) 2) Decent Camera for a budget phone. 3) good for Android smartphone beginners. 4) Can run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging. 5) Fast boot. 6) Good touch response for a budget phone, I find it to extra sensitive. hahaCons: 1) Bad Video quality for watching movies/ you tube. But I use phone only for calls, whatsapp and sometimes Instagram. I use my laptop to watch movies, so not a big deal for me. 2) Unable to share Internet hotspot to computer/Laptop. But I posted a tip on how to solve this problem in MI community India. All you need to do is download an app called PDANet+ (available in Google play store) in both your phone and computer. Go and check it out. Apart from the few drawbacks mentioned above, this phone is quite good for a budget phone. If you can live without the good video quality by watching movies/videos on another device, go for it. The 1440X720 resolution is much worse compared to Redmi 5a's 1280X720. In fact Redmi 5a's video/picture resolution is much better and detailed compared to Redmi 6a. Ordered and received another redmi 6a for my dad.\",\n",

I've been using this phone for about 1 weeks, and so far I'm loving it. Here's me breakdown:The quality, fit and finish are amazing. No one believes this is low priced phone.Battery: exceptional battery life, the best in any smartphone I've had so far.Build/design: one of the best smartphone designs and build quality I've used, even compared to much more expensive models.Camera: not as good as my Honor 7C, but still takes good enough pictures that it's not really a problem for me.Really littil bit difficult to find fault with this phone, especially for the price even I don't like the audio quality. overall Best Product. Durable solid feel, very responsive and works great overall.\",\n",

Its a different and a saperate slot for 2nd sim unlike the other phones and the phone is not recognizing the 2nd slot. It's better if both the SIM cards are placed in single slot.

You can check in ti photos . these photos are taken in day lightcamera is good for day light shooting.SoundSound quality is good, in Speaker as well as in earphone (Earphone is not provided with handset)Phone speaker is loud enough to fill a roomOS and UIComes with android version 8.1 üòäUI is Great , Easy to understand.It comes with some unnecessary pre-loaded apps which can be deleted (but not the MI apps)Network CallingI have used it in whatsapp calling only and the voice clarity was good, no issue.I will update my review after 1-2 weeks of use .Recommended ?Yes, Best smart phone according to the budget.\",\n",

I fail to understand how they could deteriorate it from previous phones. Portrait mode doesn't work properly either.
